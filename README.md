Math IA Idea generator

system for programmers:  
  For now, because we have ~3 people who are programming, each feature we want gets ~1 person on it  
  Thus, each feature, not each person, will have a branch  
  The main branch will stay as the core functionality of the robot(driving, motor movememnt), until features are done enough to be merged  
  DO NOT COMMIT DIRECTLY TO MAIN.
